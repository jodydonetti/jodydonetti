# Hi ü§å

### üíª Principal Engineer + R&D

30 years designing, developing and evolving software.

### ü¶• FusionCache

I created [FusionCache](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache): an easy to use, fast and robust hybrid cache with advanced resiliency features.

FusionCache is free and OSS, has been battle tested on real-world production apps and services for years like [HIBP (Have I Been Pwned)](https://x.com/stebets/status/1881361994340839832) and is used even [by Microsoft](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sql/data-api-builder-ga/) itself.

With the release of [v2](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/releases/tag/v2.0.0), FusionCache has become the first production-ready implementation of [Microsoft HybridCache](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/hybrid?view=aspnetcore-9.0): not just the first 3rd party implementation but the [very first](https://x.com/jodydonetti/status/1881135481645339003) at all, including Microsoft's one.

### üèÜ Awards

I've been lucky enough to receive a couple of recognitions, mostly for my work on FusionCache, and for which I'm very thankful:
- [Google OSS Award](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2021/09/announcing-latest-open-source-peer-bonus-winners.html)
- [Microsoft MVP Award](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/MVP/profile/139895de-396f-ed11-81ab-000d3a5600fa)

### üßë‚Äçüè´ Courses

If you are interested in all things caching, I published [a course](https://dometrain.com/course/getting-started-caching-in-dotnet/?ref=jody-donetti) on Dometrain:

If you like the FusionCache docs, you may like it too.

But mind you, it's not just about FusionCache but about caching as a whole: we'll go from the very foundations to pretty advanced topics and scenarios. We'll cover performance, robustness, resiliency and we'll see different real-world problems and, most importantly, solutions for them.

I tried condensing 20+ years dealing with caching in one place, all in an approachable way.

Sometimes people have this idea of inviting me to their shows.

Oooh poor souls, they don't know I can ramble for hours about all things caching.
